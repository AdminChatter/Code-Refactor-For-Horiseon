# <Accessibility refactor for Horiseon website>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
- The code for website is too hard to read. There is too much <div> function used in the file, which makes it hard to read. And repeated used propreties which can be merged together. 
- I used varies semantic elements inside the html to makes the code more appealing to the user. Some of the code in css file is deleted and merge into one unique function.
- In this project, I learnt what each semantic element is and how they fit into their location. For example for indivdual image section the code and start with <figure> instead of <div>. And during research, I learnt the image link in css file can not have an ALT text. So I learnt how to add the ALT text with the add-on feature ".visually-hidden", which need to be created and defined in the css stylesheet.
